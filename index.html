<h1>About</h1>
<p> 
My recent work at Microsoft and Nuance, I played a role as Software Quality Assurance Analyst Lead and Scrum Master; With over a decade of technical leadership experience, I've led teams to enhance telephony systems and voice recognition (conversational AI), leveraging skills in SDLC practices and Agile frameworks to deliver outstanding product quality.

The core of my professional journey is to drive innovation and maintain high standards in product development, underscored by a commitment to fostering a culture of continuous improvement and team productivity.

EXPERERTIS INCLUDES: 
• Leading test engineers, ensuring application functionality and quality testing from planning to execution of interactive voice response (IVR) product and SaaS env services. 
• Guide test engineers and distributed assignments in different time zones. Coordinated multiple cross-functional teams to deliver good quality overall IVR project and SaaS env services.
• Software development testing, automation tools, web app security testing.
• Azure development, cloud-native applications, microservices, and distributed systems in a cloud environment; including Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Prometheus, Setting up VM cluster, AKS. 
• Testing AI SW which has the ability to recognize speech as input and synthesize spoken output. The combination of speech capabilities together with the ability to apply NLP analysis of text enables a form of human-compute interaction that's known as conversational AI, in which users can interact with AI agents (usually referred to as bots by PVA) in much the same way they would with another human.
• Act as Designated Responsible Individual (DRI), directly addressing and mitigating customer IcM outage severity rating issues in production, solving technical problems. 
• Act as Scrum Master to team for large-scale technology projects related to Cloud AI services in complex solutions such as speech recognition. Grew and managed global engineering teams and drove innovation in Cloud technologies.
